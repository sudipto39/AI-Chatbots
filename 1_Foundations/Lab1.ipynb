      "A mathematician is standing in a room with two light switches. One switch controls a light in a room that is currently off, but is located on the other side of a solid wall. The second switch controls a light in a room that is currently on, but is located in the same room as the mathematician. However, the mathematician cannot see either light switch. He can turn the lights on and off as many times as he wants, but only during the day when the room is visible through a small window. How can the mathematician figure out which switch corresponds to which light?\n"

      "- If the light in the first room (controlled by switch 2) was originally OFF, but turned ON when you turned switch 1 ON for 5 minutes, then switch 1 corresponds to the light in the second room.\n",

When the bulb is first turned on it will appear white or very close to that but after being turned off then back on the LED turns an orange/yellowish color.\n",
